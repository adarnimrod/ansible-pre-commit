Ansible `pre-commit <http://pre-commit.com/>`_ hooks.

- ansible-syntax-check: The hook runs
  :code:`ansible --syntax-check` against playbooks declared.
- ansible-vault-check: The hook verifies that files that have :code:`vault` in
  the filename are indeed vaulted.

Requirements
------------

- Pre-commit 1.2 or later.
- Python 2.7 or 3.6 or later.

Installation
------------

Add the following to your :code:`.pre-commit-config.yaml`:

.. code:: yaml

    - repo: https://git.shore.co.il/ansible/ansible-pre-commit.git
      sha: v0.9.0
      hooks:
      - id: ansible-syntax-check
        files: site.yml #In case you want to specify other playbook files.
      - id: ansible-vault-check

And in the next :code:`pre-commit` will install and run the hooks. In case
your :code:`roles` directory isn't in the same directory as the playbook
you're testing or at :code:`/etc/ansible/roles` you need to declare the roles
search path in :code:`ansible.cfg` in the root of the repo like so:

.. code::

    [defaults]
    roles_path=path/to/roles/directory:path/to/another/roles/directory
